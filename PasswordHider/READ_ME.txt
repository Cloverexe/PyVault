Welcome to my password hider!

NOTE: PYCHARM IS NEEDED TO OPEN CODE FILE AS WELL AS PYTHON (I THINK)
	BOTH CAN BE FOUND BELOW:
		https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
		https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/

The idea of this was created at 11:30pm so its not really practical to be honest.
Instructions on use:
When this folder is first download you will see a couple files and folders.
the Passwordhider you see there is the code making up this program.

The actual executable is found under "dist"

when opened it asks for a passcode,
default is 1123
It then displays just a example login.

To set a new passcode and change the contents of what is displayed after it is entered, open the code file in the main directory,
and follow instructions written in the comments (Every line starting with a #)

NOTE: DELETE THE FOLLOWING FILES BEFORE CREATING A NEW EXECUTABLE:
	_pycache_
	build
	dist
	Passswordhider.spec
OR THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES WHILE MAKING A NEW EXECUTABLE.
Then follow the directions on the website below to create a new executable:
